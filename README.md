SEC EDGAR Corpus Project
The SEC EDGAR Corpus project is designed to help users extract and analyze company filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR database. This tool simplifies the retrieval of important financial documents, such as 10-Q (quarterly reports), 10-K (annual reports), and other corporate filings, which are essential for financial analysis, research, and decision-making.
